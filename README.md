# SYCL-FFT

## Introduction

SYCL-FFT is a library implementing Fast Fourier Transforms using SYCL and C++.
SYCL-FFT is in early stages of development and will support more options and optimizations in the future.

## Pre-requisites

* A SYCL implementation such as [DPC++].
* CMake

## Getting Started

Clone SYCL-FFT and run the following commands from the cloned repository.

Build using DPC++ 2023.1.0 as:

```shell
source /opt/intel/oneapi/compiler/2023.1.0/env/vars.sh
cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=${ONEAPI_ROOT}/compiler/2023.1.0/linux/bin-llvm/clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=${ONEAPI_ROOT}/compiler/2023.1.0/linux/bin-llvm/clang -DSYCLFFT_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DSYCLFFT_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON
cmake --build build
```

Build using DPC++ nightlies as (SPIR64 target only):

```shell
cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/dpcpp/bin/clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/dpcpp/bin/clang -DSYCLFFT_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DSYCLFFT_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON
cmake --build build
```

To compile AOT for a specific device, mention the target device as 

```
-DSYCLFFT_DEVICE_TRIPLE=<T>[T1,..,Tn]
```

The list of available targets can be found on [DPC++ compiler documentation page].
Some AOT targets do not support double precision. 
To disable the building of tests and benchmarks using double precision, set `-DSYCLFFT_ENABLE_DOUBLE_BUILDS=OFF`.

Run the tests from the build folder with:

```shell
ctest
```

Run pre-defined benchmarks from the build folder with:

```shell
./test/bench/bench_float
```

Run manual benchmarks from the build folder with for instance:

```shell
./test/bench/bench_manual_float d=cpx,n=5
```

Use the `--help` flag to print help message on the configuration syntax.

## Troubleshooting

The library should compile without error on our supported platforms.
If you run into trouble, or think you have found a bug, we have a support
forum available through the [developer website], or create an issue on GitHub.
